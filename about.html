		I am web developer from Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm a student of computer science, and I like music, playing guitar and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momo_(dumpling)" target="_blank" title="Mo:Mo:">Mo:Mo:</a>s.
		And some adventures could be good for refreshment.
		I consider me and myself only as the reason for the existence of this blog.
