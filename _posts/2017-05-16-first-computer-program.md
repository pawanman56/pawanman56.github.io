<h2><b>How to start your first computer programming?</b></h2>

For the beginners and intrested individuals, the main problem with learning the computer programming seems to be the lack of idea about progression of the steps to start with the computer programming. Most of them are not properly introduced with the computer programming. Programming is not as shown in mainstream media (rapid typing, green terminals, etc.). Programming actually takes your time and patience for solving any problem. After the concept of programming is clear, it's time to choose one programming language.

<h3><b>1. Programming Language</b></h3>
Programming language is the predefined set of instructions that are used to produce various outputs. Generally, programming language is the instruction for a computer. Choosing a programming language depends upon the characteristics and the goal of the program that you're going to make.There are variety of programming languages that you can pick as your starter, and if you feel like the language is not convenient enough for you then you can always move on to another one.

Based on the difficulty, popularity and platform, programming languages for starters can be listed as below:
<h4><u><b>C, C++, C#</b></u></h4>
- Difficult but not imposiible.
- Widely used and popular (standalone desktop applicaitons).

<h4><u><b>Python</b></u></h4>
- Versatile language(used across several platform).
- Powerful and relatively easy.

<h4><u><b>Ruby</b></u></h4>
- Dynamic and object-oriented scripting language (used in web development and mobile apps).
- Simple, readable and easy (similar to python).

<h4><u><b>JavaScrpit</b></u></h4>
- Magical language (sounds related to Java, but are entirely different languages).
- Use to create Web-plugins (and many more).

<h4><u><b>Java</b></u></h4>
- High demands.
- Popular (mainly mobile apps)..

<h4><u><b>PHP</b></u></h4>
- Hypertext Processor (web programming language).
- Easy and popular (server side programming).

Once you grap the gist of the any one programming language of your choice, you can broaden your knowledge by not limiting to only one language. Don't keep your yourself limited, explore many languages of your interest.


<h3><b>2. How To Learn Language</b></h3>
Once you've decided upon which programming language to take you're are ready to learn programming. For many corporates, having programming skills is more important than the good grades. But that doesn't mean that school isn't important. College degree adds extra points to your portfolio. Some expert guidance from your teacher and help from friends would be more efficient than rather you teaching yourself.

Tutorials sites can be best guide for any confusion, and are best source for solutions. [Tutorials Point], [Code Academy], [Treehouse], etc. are some best examples for online tutorial sites. There are also lots tutorials channels in [Youtube] (for ease) where you can find playlists with guidance for learning the specific programming langugages. [Brackeys], [Codemy School], and [The Coding Train] are some of my favourites channels. With some time in research (basically searching, in this case) you surely will land on the channel that you find fitting to your taste.

There are lots of online universities/learning portals from where you can enroll any course (maybe paid or free depending upon the institutes) of your choice. Online degree and genuine accreditation can be achieved from online courses. [Coursera] provides most of its course free of cost. There are also lots of online developers education programs available that provides you with the documentations and development tools to help in your training. This also helps in polishing their platforms to make their resources best on the web. For e.g. [Google's Android Training], [Mozilla Developer Network], [Facebook For Developers], and lots of other. So, my suggestion here is to start at young.

<h3><b>3. What To Do After Step 2?</b></h3>

Learning doesn't stop here. You should keep on teaching yourself. Once you get the hang of your first programming language, I would recommend you to shift to another language. Keeping yourself updated with the changing technology is cosidered as good trait of programming. Thus, again I suggests not to limit yourself only on one language. Keeps learning and updating yourself.

<br>
<h3><b>To Sum Up</b></h3>
Technology is dynamic, fun, interesting, and inextricable part of our daily lives. Programming, as tool for technology development, is also fun and extremely useful. Programming helps to span your creativity and professionalism. Hence, considering above steps will surely be quite helpful for your first step to the computer programming.

And that's all folk.
